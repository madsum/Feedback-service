# Feedback-service

We have run backend service first:   
cd feedback-back/  
npm instal  
npm run start  
At this point you should see in the terminal `server is listening on 4000`    
Please keep this app running.

Then start another terminal and run frontend app:-  
cd feedback-front/    
npm instal    
npm run start  

For testing pleas try to give high rating 7 or greater than 7. Also lower rating less than 7. After submitting all question you will see Thank you page. Then try this `http://localhost:4000/getFeedback` It will return submitted results.
